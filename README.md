# The Orbital Debris Ontology (ODO)
The Orbital Debris Ontology (ODO)[1] is a computational ontology representing orbital debris in orbit about Earth (or any central body), and other relevant orbital entities. It represents orbital objects, more broadly, and the relationships between them and the central astronomical body or bodies in question. The orbital debris domain involves observation, detection, identificaiton, tracking and propogation (predition of future behavior or motion) of objects in space (part of space situational awareness). The central focus is the orbital space environment.

##Purpose and Goals##
* To facilitate data-sharing and integration among orbital debris and space object catalogues
* To engender international cooperation among SSA communities
* To formally model orbital debris entities

...in order to help ensure global orbital space safety and security of Earth and space-borne assetts (satellites, etc.).

NOTE: Contact rrovetto@terpalum.umd.edu if you are interested in helping with this ontology or the broader project. Persons, e.g., university professors, interested in applying to grants with me, or coauthoring, should also contact me.

##Status##
The ontology is in preliminary stages of development, no claims to completeness are made, and the both the ontology and its name are subject to revision. Lack of development is due to lack of funded opportuninty to sustainably work on it.

I AM SEEKING OPPORTUNITIES to sustainably development on this ontology, such as...
* funding, applying to grants with professors in relevant/related disciplines 
* cooperative partnernships, interdisciplinary team, co-workers, advisors
* PhD or MS fellowship, where this or the overall project concept can serve as a degree thesis/project 
* a related employment or contract position; or a research assistant/associate position
...to realize the concept

CONTEXT-EFFORTS: This has been a pursuit since 2011, when I conceived of this concept (verification available upon request).  Since then I've been searching for a funded opportunity (employment, PhD fellowship, research position, researcher-training network, mentors, a team, etc.) to sustainably work on, develop, and implement this ontology in a team environment with professionals in astrodynamics, astroinformatics, computer science, and ontology engineering. I have developed enough paper cocepts on this to make it a Phd project.

##A Note on Domain-Demarcation##
Given that the name focuses on orbital debris, a generalization will allow ODO classes to be part of or imported into a broader ontology: e.g., an Orbital Space Ontology[3][4], Orbital Object Ontology, Space Situational Awareness Ontology [2], etc. See my other repositories. The demarcation of ODO and my related ontologies is under development, and the overall ontology suite subject to revision.
